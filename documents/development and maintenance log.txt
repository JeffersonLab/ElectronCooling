1. Add BMZ and BMC model for ibs calculation. (Bjorken-Mtingwa model with all terms.)
2. Change ibs_by_element output into sdds format. 

09/08/2020
1.Merge electron beam edge effect into master. 

09/06/2020
1. A line that is consist of nine or more consecutive "=" is considered the end of the script. 
2. New command: append, appendstr, savestr
3. Use local time for record and file name.

1. Add the fixed-bunch-length feature to the particle model. 

05/21/2020
1. Define the angles of the Gaussian electron bunch.

1. Change the default output file name to "output_" followed by the input script file.
2. Add "cv_l" (longitudinal center velocity) to the electron beam, which allows to add an additional 
longitudinal velocity shift to the electron beam conveniently. 
3. Print the input script file name to screen.

05/06/2020
1. Allow to print multiple variables at once, such as PRINT X, Y, Z.
2. Fixed the bug that math functions cannot be recognized. This is because the math functions are
defined in lower case in the muMathparser, which is actually case sensitive, but JSPEC2 converts 
the input file into upper case for convenience. Now most math functions are redefined in upper case.

05/03/2020
1. Add four formulas for non-magnetized friction force calculation: nonmag-Derbenev, nonmag-Meshkov, 
nonmag-num1D, nonmag-num3D.
2. Add section_comment. Everything in this section will be treated as comments.
3. Now one can save the output to a file besides the screen. 
4. Now one can use "=== END ===" to end the script file. Anything below this command will be ignored.
This command is not required to run the script file. It provides the convenience to users who want to
record some results at the end of the script file and the script file is still runnable.

1. Use multiple electron bunches (same bunch but at different positions) simultaneously to cool an ion bunch
2. Now allow to break a long line into multiple lines. 
3. Replace trim_blank, trim_tab with trim_whitespace.
